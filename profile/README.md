# Hi there!
This is my dumpster org for all kind of legacy (and mostly ewaste) devices I've worked on in the past.  
Some of my old stuff which won't be maintained by me anymore is now public for everyone! Because __maybe__ someone will find something useful here!  
Some trees might be a total mess and lacking proper authorship whatsoever (because they were never meant to be published), you've been warned.  
Note: most of these trees are probably not 100% stable, so don't expect to get a fully working ROM out of these!

## Current public projects
* Wiko Lenny 2 (s5030) => cm-14.1
* Amazon Fire TV Stick 2nd Gen (tank) => cm-14.1
* HTC One Mini (m4) => cm-14.1
* HTC One A9s (e36ml) => cm-14.1
* ZTE Blade A910 (P635A31) => lineage-15.1

For more Projects on this Org, check this [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ZYsNwNjpRzRwXdSQ-JvW2vVeNvKTMCTS6GHbcL_9o8) on the Ultra-Legacy tab!  
If you own any of these devices and you're interested in helping, hit me up!
